      **2017–2018**: As the first API technical writer in
      Booking.com's Partner Services department, I was responsible for the
      entire API documentation process, including planning, writing, visual
      design, and (automated) testing. I also advised other teams on
      documentation best practices, and ran technical writing workshops for
      non-writers.

      **2020**: After a little more than a year in Tokyo, I rejoined Booking.com
      to pioneer the documentation process, tooling, and information architecture
      for their payments platform.
