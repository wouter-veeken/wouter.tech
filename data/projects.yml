    description: |
      Online help for a software product called Visit Connect. I worked on this
      from November 2016 to October 2017. I rewrote and converted a legacy 
      Microsoft Word-based user guide into a fully responsive HTML5
      help site using [MadCap Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare/). 
      I also [coordinated translations into 4 languages](/blog/translating-flare-without-lingo/).
