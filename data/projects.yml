      Online help for a software product called Visit Connect. I worked on this
      from November 2016 to October 2017. In addition to rewriting and
      converting a legacy Word-based user guide into a fully responsive HTML5
      help site (using MadCap Flare), I also coordinated translations into 4
      languages (see related blog post).
