* Everyone knows data there's money in data, but very few people really understand why. There seems to be a fundamental belief that data is valuable by definition. That obviously can't be true. Not all data is created equal, and some data is worthless. Only experts can really tell good data from bad data.

_Not all data is personal data._ No, it isn't. But then again, it is. Data science (for commercial purposes) is essentially about predicting human behavior. If you can't prove, at least to yourself, that every single data point is traceable to a real human being, then your data is unreliable and worthless.
