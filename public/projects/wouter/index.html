<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p>W.O.U.T.E.R. stands for Word Ontology, Unified Termbase and Exportable Reference and, by weird coincidence, also happens to be my first name. It is meant for technical writers and translators who need a simple way of creating small(ish), structured termbases.</p>

<p>W.O.U.T.E.R. consists of a prepared Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with a number of attached Visual Basic modules. Combined, they allow you to produce simple multilingual glossaries, gradually enrich entries with terminological data, and finally transform the entire thing into a TBX terminology file, which can then be used in most professional translation and terminology management tools.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>W.O.U.T.E.R. arose out of a terminology management project in one of my previous jobs. I was working in a large, distributed software R&amp;D unit, containing dozens of technical writers based in different countries. We had been tasked with localizing the user interfaces of multiple software products from English into our respective native languages, and/or the other way around. At the same time, we were coordinating the translation of the associated user guides and help files by external translators. This was a fairly complex undertaking, made more complicated by several factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many of the English source texts had been produced by non-native speakers, and thus contained many ambiguities, mistranslations and inconsistencies;</p></li>

<li><p>very few of the technical writers involved in the project were trained translators familiar with accepted best practices, quality control methods and other aspects of the translation world;</p></li>

<li><p>most of the products being localized had been originally developed by different teams, from different countries, each using their own specialized lexicon;</p></li>

<li><p>most of the products were integrated with each other to some degree, making it important that they used the same basic terminology.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In short, we had a great need for effective terminology management tools and processes, but unfortunately had access to neither. As one of the few formally trained translators in the company, I could tell that we were hopelessly out of our depth.</p>

<p>Most technical writers and translators, as part of their work, spend some time moderating the use of terminology in their team or organization. This requires them to create glossaries that they have to share with others. When they don&rsquo;t have access to professional terminology management software (i.e. almost never), they will invariably use Microsoft Excel. This is because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Excel offers a simple table/grid interface, which is ideal for this type of thing;</li>
<li>everyone else they work with has Excel.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a simple, but not very scalable solution. Excel will work fine for smaller glossaries with not too many terms or languages, but it becomes drastically less practical as more terms and languages are added. Almost always, the glossary ends up being frustrating to maintain, difficult to share with others, and impossible to transform into another format. Many hours of work are lost this way.</p>

<p>W.O.U.T.E.R. exploits the good parts of Excel (its accessibility) while offering a way around its limitations. You start off with a simple Excel sheet that requires virtually no  giving them a familiar environment to work in, while offering the guarantee that their work can be converted to a more scalable, flexible format later.</p>
